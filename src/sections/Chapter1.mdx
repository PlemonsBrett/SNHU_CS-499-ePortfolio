  My journey began not in a classroom, but with a screwdriver and an insatiable curiosity. As a kid, I couldn't resist taking apart electronicsâ€”not to break them, but to understand the magic happening inside. That same drive to understand, to build, to improve has been the constant thread weaving through every chapter of my career.

  While working at Best Buy's Geek Squad, I discovered that fixing computers wasn't enough. I craved creation, not just restoration. So I embarked on a transformative journey, spending nights and weekends evolving from someone who repaired technology to someone who architected it. Self-taught and relentless, I turned curiosity into capability, one line of code at a time.
