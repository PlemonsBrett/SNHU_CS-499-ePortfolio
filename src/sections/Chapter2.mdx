  Sometimes the most valuable lessons come wrapped in the most difficult experiences. At RevLogical, I dove headfirst into the deep end of software engineering—mobile apps, real-time systems, IoT integration with drones and LiDAR. I was learning exponentially, but paying a steep price: 120+ hour weeks, no boundaries, constant pressure.

  It wasn't sustainable, but it was transformational. I emerged with battle-tested skills and an unshakeable understanding of what great engineering culture should—and shouldn't—look like. Every sleepless night taught me resilience. Every impossible deadline taught me prioritization. Every system I built taught me the elegance of well-architected solutions.

  Then Dictionary.com found me. They didn't just hire an engineer with broad exposure—they invested in someone who could grow, lead, and inspire others. Within six months, I was leading teams. Within a year, I was managing Platform, Core Systems, Mobile, and Machine Learning engineering across the organization.
