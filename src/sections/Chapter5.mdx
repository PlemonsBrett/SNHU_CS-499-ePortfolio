  This isn't just about career progression—it's about leveraging technology to connect people across barriers of language, distance, and difference. My formative years in Okinawa instilled a deep appreciation for communication across cultures. My leadership experience taught me that the best solutions serve human needs first, technical elegance second.

  As I transition toward ML/AI specialization, I carry with me:

    - **The curiosity** that drove me to take apart my first computer
    - **The resilience** forged through challenging projects and difficult decisions
    - **The leadership wisdom** earned by building and nurturing high-performing teams
    - **The technical excellence** proven across multiple domains and industries
    - **The strategic thinking** that transforms complex problems into elegant solutions

  The future of technology isn't just about what we can build—it's about what we choose to build, and why. I'm committed to creating AI solutions that amplify human potential rather than replace human connection.
