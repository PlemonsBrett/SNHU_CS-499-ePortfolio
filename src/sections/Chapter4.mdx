  As I complete my BS in Computer Science at SNHU this August--specializing in Machine Learning & AI with advanced coursework in calculus, differential equations, and statistical modeling--I'm not just earning a degree. I'm preparing for the next chapter of my story.

  The convergence is powerful: over a decade of production engineering experience, deep leadership wisdom, and now the mathematical foundation to tackle the most exciting frontier in technology. My weekend experiments with audio processing and speech synthesis aren't just hobbies—they're glimpses into a future where I can combine my passion for building systems with the transformative potential of AI.

  Working alongside our VP of ML and AI at Propio has confirmed what I suspected: the most impactful solutions emerge when engineering excellence meets artificial intelligence. I'm not abandoning leadership—I'm evolving it, bringing strategic thinking and systems architecture to the world of machine learning.
