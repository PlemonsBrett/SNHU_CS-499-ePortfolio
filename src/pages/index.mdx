  My journey began not in a classroom, but with a screwdriver and an insatiable curiosity. As a kid, I couldn't resist taking apart electronics to understand their inner workings. That same drive—to understand, to build, to improve—has been the constant thread throughout my career.

  While working at Best Buy's Geek Squad, I discovered that fixing computers wasn't enough. I wanted to create solutions, not just apply them. So I taught myself to code, spending nights and weekends transforming from a repair technician into a software engineer.

  title="The Early Years"
  subtitle="From Contracting to Leadership"

  I reached out to HitchPin asking if they needed a developer even though they weren't hiring—and they took a chance on me. As I grew, I wanted more experiences, so I started contracting. First with Blue Cross Blue Shield, then the State of Kansas. But I didn't like the instability of contract work. I decided to look for something more...

  I found RevLogical, where I moved quickly and learned so much:
  - How to develop mobile apps in React Native, then Flutter
  - How to build real-time applications through an auction platform
  - How retail works by building a point-of-sale system
  - How systems and hardware programming work with drones, RFID, and LiDAR

  But it wasn't sustainable. I was working 120+ hours per week, and even on "vacation" I was called constantly and berated.

  Then a recruiter from Dictionary.com found me—and saved me. They took in an engineer with lots of exposure and a hard work ethic, and helped mold me into an engineer who cared and wanted to mentor others. I started as a Senior Engineer, and through happenstance moved quickly—within 6 months into leadership, within a year managing Platform, Core Systems, Mobile, and Machine Learning.

  Then Dictionary.com was purchased by IXL, and they decided to lay off our entire staff. During this time, my team was fortunate to have essentially a 90-day notice, and Analytics was moved under me. I started the job hunt, saddened by having to leave the team and company I had grown with over two years. Even now I almost tear up thinking about it—nothing has been the same since.

  A recruiter reached out about MFour Mobile Research, hiring me as an Engineering Manager to help grow their team toward a Director/VP role. But in the 9 months I was there, we only laid off employees. Discussions of hiring were out of the question, which eventually led to me parting ways after finding Propio Language Services.

  At Propio, I realized this might be the first time I was actually just a manager. I spend more than 80% of my time in meetings and planning. Previously, even as a manager, I could still contribute 30-40% of what my senior developers did. I started thinking: maybe I don't like being a manager this much. I feel more like a Product Manager.

  Then I met our newly hired VP of ML and AI. We hit it off immediately through my passion for ML/AI and the ideas I'd been experimenting with on weekends. He was super excited and has started pushing to get me on his team as an MLE, working toward my goal of specializing in Audio Processing and Speech Synthesis!

  As I complete my BS in Computer Science at SNHU this August (specializing in Machine Learning & AI with a minor in Applied Mathematics), I'm preparing for the next evolution of my career. With a foundation in calculus, differential equations, and advanced statistics, combined with over a decade of production engineering experience, I'm uniquely positioned to make an impact in ML/AI.

  My goal is clear: to become a Machine Learning Engineer specializing in Audio Processing and Speech Synthesis, combining my passion for AI with practical engineering excellence.
