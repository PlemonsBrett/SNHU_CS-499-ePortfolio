  My journey began not in a classroom, but with a screwdriver and an insatiable curiosity. As a kid, I couldn't resist taking apart electronics to understand their inner workings. That same drive—to understand, to build, to improve—has been the constant thread throughout my career.

  While working at Best Buy's Geek Squad, I discovered that fixing computers wasn't enough. I wanted to create solutions, not just apply them. So I taught myself to code, spending nights and weekends transforming from a repair technician into a software engineer.

  Each role has been a stepping stone, expanding my impact from individual contributions to organizational transformation. At Dictionary.com, I didn't just manage teams—I revolutionized how we built and delivered products, achieving:

      <div class="stat-label">User Retention Increase</div>

      <div class="stat-number">83%</div>
      <div class="stat-label">Release Cycle Time Reduction</div>
    </div>
  </div>

  But numbers only tell part of the story. The real impact came from building teams that could sustain and amplify these improvements long after implementation.

  As I complete my Computer Science degree at SNHU this August (specializing in ML & AI with a minor in Applied Mathematics), I'm not just adding credentials—I'm preparing for the next evolution of technology leadership.

  The intersection of robust engineering practices and cutting-edge AI capabilities isn't just where technology is heading—it's where I can make the most impact. Whether it's building MLOps pipelines, tackling audio synthesis challenges, or creating the next generation of intelligent systems, I bring both the technical depth and leadership experience to turn ambitious visions into reality.
