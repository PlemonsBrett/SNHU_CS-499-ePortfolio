  My journey began not in a classroom, but with a screwdriver and an insatiable curiosity. While working at Best Buy's Geek Squad, I discovered that fixing computers wasn't enough—I wanted to create solutions, not just apply them.

  I taught myself to code, spending nights and weekends transforming from a repair technician into a software engineer. Along the way, I:
  
  - Created software solutions that streamlined vulnerability tracking and repair processes
  - Developed comprehensive training programs that increased operational efficiency by 30%
  - Trained over 50 employees, improving service delivery and technical expertise
  
  This foundation of continuous learning and improvement would become the cornerstone of my career—from those early days troubleshooting hardware to eventually leading engineering teams at scale.

  At Dictionary.com, I didn't just manage teams—I revolutionized how we built and delivered products. As Staff Software Engineer and then Senior Engineering Manager, I led initiatives that transformed both technology and culture:

      <div class="stat-number">83%</div>
      <div class="stat-label">Release Cycle Time Reduction</div>
    </div>

  As I complete my BS in Computer Science at SNHU this August (specializing in Machine Learning & AI with a minor in Applied Mathematics), I'm not just adding credentials—I'm preparing for the next evolution of technology leadership.

  With a foundation in calculus, differential equations, and advanced statistics, combined with over a decade of production engineering experience, I'm uniquely positioned to bridge the gap between theoretical AI and practical implementation.

  The future isn't just about understanding AI—it's about building scalable, reliable systems that harness its power responsibly and effectively.
