## From Curiosity to Code

My journey in technology began with curiosity and a screwdriver—taking apart electronics as a kid to understand how they worked. That same drive to understand and improve systems has shaped my entire career, from my early days as a self-taught developer to leading engineering teams and now transitioning into Machine Learning Engineering.

## The Next Chapter

As I complete my Computer Science degree at SNHU this August (specializing in ML & AI with a minor in Applied Mathematics), I'm excited to apply my systems architecture background to MLOps, audio processing, and speech synthesis challenges. The intersection of robust engineering practices and cutting-edge AI capabilities is where I see the future of technology—and where I want to make my next impact.

When I'm not building systems or leading teams, you'll find me experimenting with game design, practicing crochet (yes, really), or exploring the latest developments in machine learning. I believe the best engineers are lifelong learners, and I'm always ready for the next challenge that will push both my technical and leadership skills forward.
