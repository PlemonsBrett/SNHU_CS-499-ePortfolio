## Project Overview

Liar's Dice is a classic bluffing game brought to life through modern C++ with intelligent AI opponents, sophisticated algorithms, and comprehensive data persistence. This project serves as the capstone for my Computer Science degree, demonstrating mastery across software engineering, algorithms, and database design.

### Key Features

- **Intelligent AI Opponents** - Multiple difficulty levels using Bayesian inference and Monte Carlo simulations
- **Modern Architecture** - Dependency injection, event-driven design, and comprehensive testing
- **Performance Optimized** - SIMD vectorization, custom data structures, and efficient memory management
- **Secure Database Layer** - SQLite integration with authentication, statistics tracking, and achievement system
- **Professional Development** - CMake build system, Doxygen documentation, and 95%+ test coverage

## Game Rules

Players take turns making increasingly bold claims about dice hidden under cups. Each bid must either increase the quantity or face value from the previous bid. When someone calls "liar," all dice are revealed—the loser loses points (1 point for lying, 2 points for false accusation). Players start with 5 points and are eliminated when they run out. Last player standing wins!
